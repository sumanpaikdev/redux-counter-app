# Redux-Powered React Application



Along the way, we learned how to:

* Create actions, action creators, reducers, and the store
* Provide the store to the app using `<Provider>`
* Read/ access the store from components using the `useSelector` hook and display the state information in the UI
* Dispatch the actions on user events such as button clicks, using the `useDispatch` hook
* Control the DOM elements' behavior with logic based on the state of the application
* We learnt what are the disadvantages of in-efficient state management and multiple level of prop drilling
